# when disconnected from the internet.  We then have a script to update the cached copies.

# Because of that, each entry in this mapping should have this format:
#   name: ('http://UPSTREAM_URL', (None, 'path/to/local/cache.inv'))
#
# The update script depends on this format so deviating from this (for instance, adding a third
# location for the mappning to live) will confuse it.
